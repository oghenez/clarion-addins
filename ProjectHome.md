> # Open Source Addins for the Clarion IDE (v7+) #

This project will eventually host all of the source code for the addins I have created for the Clarion IDE. If you have any addins of your own you would like to contribute to, please let me know!

  * The source code is in Visual Studio 2010 projects.
  * Currently I intend to host the source code **only**. Compiled binaries are available from http://clarionaddins.com

Please leave a message if you are compiling these yourself, I am very interested to hear what you think and how they are working for you!
